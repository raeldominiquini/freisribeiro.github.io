  Digital Fabrication Research Blog

Hey!

I'm Fernanda Reis Ribeiro, I'm an Architecture and Urban Planning undergraduate student at University of Brasilia, Brazil. I did a year architecture exchange program at Louisiana State University, and now I'm a summer researcher at Illinois Institute of Technology. The focus of this research is to  create innovative software and hardware workflows for design experimentation using consumer grade fabrication technologies (CNC, 3D printing, laser cutter).
This blog is dedicated to show a daily evolution of my research.
