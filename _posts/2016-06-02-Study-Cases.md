## Study Cases: prisms

After looking on some ways that light can be used as a protagonist on different applications, such as fixtures, furniture or architecture, I started to search for other types of interaction, rather than light and digital fabricated patterns. 

A prism is defined by a transparent body of glass, with triangular shape, that can separate white light into a spectrum of different colors. The three projects shown below use prisms as a way of creating a connection between users and light. The prisms are placed in specific locations on the digital fabricated form to allow the conversion of natural light into rainbow spots, beams and surfaces.
