## Study Case: prisms

*"I experienced a space filled with the light of Matisse: Being bathed in the sunlight of the Provence, the stained glass with Matisse's vibrant colors suffused the room with full of colors. Since then, I had been dreaming of designing an architecture where people can feel the light with all senses."* Yoshioka, Tokujin
      
      
      
After looking on some ways that light can be used as a protagonist on different applications, such as fixtures, furniture or architecture, I started to search for other types of interaction, rather than light and digital fabricated patterns. 

A prism is defined by a transparent body of glass, with triangular shape, that can separate white light into a spectrum of different colors. The three projects shown below use prisms as a way of creating a connection between users and light. The prisms are placed in specific locations on the digital fabricated form to allow the conversion of natural light into rainbow spots, beams and surfaces.


###  1. Tonkin Liu, Rainbow Gate

Emphasizing history, light, and structure, the Rainbow gate, located in Burnley, UK, was designed by the office Tonkin Liu in 2012. The Pavilion is situated in a strategic circulation point, where three major routes meet. *“On a rainy day water will drum against the thin steel roof as it channels and runs to the ground. The rain is then in a way recorded or remembered by way of 133 prisms which capture sunlight after a storm (or just on a sunny day) to create hundreds of artificial rainbows.”*

### 2. Steven Holl, NYU Philosophy Department

The NYU building, located in the NoHo Historic District, received in 2007 an interior renovation by the architect Steven Holl. The renovation included the installation of a 6 story stair shaft, which used the concept of porosity to create a light vertical connection. On the outside of south-facing openings, a prismatic film was installed to break the sunlight into rainbow light beams.

### 3. Tokujin Yoshioka, Rainbow Church

In May 2010, the Japanese architect Tokujin Yoshioka, exhibited her “Rainbow Church”, an 8-meter-high installation composed of 500 crystal prisms, in Seoul, South Korea. According to Yoshioka, the intention was to build an architecture where people can feel the light with all the senses.

The interesting fact is that the use of prism provoke different reactions and can promote a deeper contact between human being and architecture. In other words, the light diffused by the prism creates a specific and unique image of the building for the user.
