How create caustics through a non-natural way?

A group collaboration between MIT and Harvard University developed a glass 3d printer. The new equipment can print glass in different shapes and colors, providing a variety of optical effects. The creators of the project say that the mechanism can be seen as a potential use in architecture and design.

Neri Oxman, director of the Mediated Matter Group says that “Mies [van der Rohe]’s glass skyscraper was to us more than an inspiration because at its core is the belief that technological innovation can drive form and function. … [I]n this project, we wanted to explore the possibility of creating architectural building skins that are at once structurally sound, environmentally informed, and have the potential to contain and flow media through them.” Source: Architect Magazine
