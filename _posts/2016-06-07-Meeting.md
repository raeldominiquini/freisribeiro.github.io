### Research Meeting

The research meeting today focused on developing 3D patterns using Grasshopper. The class also produced a series of exercises on how to prepare a 3d model to be printed. With this exercise I could see the possibilities of grasshopper in generating surfaces and solids constructed by a repetition of an element. Some of the work made today is shown below.
