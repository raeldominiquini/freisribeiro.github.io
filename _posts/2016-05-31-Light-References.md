## Light: The natural agent that stimulates sight and makes things visible. 

This definition from Oxford dictionary shows the idea of light in practical way. By practical way I mean the use of light on everyday life. The light you use to perform your activities, to read a book, to cook, to draw, to observe the neighborhood… It is the light that is always present, but it acts in a secondary role. My main question is what you can get, when this light, produced by natural or artificial ways, is put in a main role. When this light not only acts as a tool, but as a product, an object that could be manipulated and could inspire. When this “natural agent” is seen as a protagonist it can be definitely used not only as a sight stimulator, but it can also stimulate the human psychological side, it can create experiences and generate ideas.

Thereby, I became interested in the way that light can be manipulated by digital fabrication. The combination of these two elements can be seen in different scales and purposes. To illustrate these distinct applications, I’ve selected some projects, which by the use of digital softwares and machines as generators, can produce interesting patterns of light and shadow 

### 1.	Fixtures

The American architect Steven Holl and Nick Gelpi developed, in 2007, a table based on the concept of porosity. The furniture was produced using the CNC milling process.
According to the manufacturer website, “The originality and workmanship of its legs are the outstanding features of the Riddled table, which incorporates the notion of porosity found in multiple architecture works by Steven Holl. The thin sheets of wood, folded through laser engraving, make this project even more spectacular in its apparent defiance of the laws of physics. These two legs, akin to origami sculptures, allow the passage of the internal light to create a myriad of lights and shadows.” Horm.it
