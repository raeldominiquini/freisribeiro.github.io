*"Investigating how new digital fabrication techniques can be employed in construction with ice together with the study of light and sound, Caustic Architecture research gave birth to the Synesthetic Museum. Re-thinking how light can evolve into inhabitable spaces; the museum redefines how people occupy the built environment through light caustics and sound, hence experiencing a homogeneous correlation between the volumetric qualities of both. The design represents the visual analysis of light as a phenomenon, but in principle its architecture represents a study of caustic light performance and how it is scattered in a space."*
