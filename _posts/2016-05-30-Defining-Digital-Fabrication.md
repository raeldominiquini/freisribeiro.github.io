#Defining Digital Fabrication

According to Opendesk, a british design company, Digital fabrication is defined as "a type of manufacturing process where the machine used is controlled by a computer. The most common forms of digital fabrication are:

- CNC Machining (Computer Numerical Control): where, typically, shapes are cut out of wooden sheets

- 3D Printing: where objects are built up out of layers of metal or plastic

- Laser Cutting: where materials like metal are burnt or melted by a laser beam

There are a huge range of digital fabrication techniques. The important aspect that unifies them is that the machines can reliably be programmed to make consistent products from digital designs."
