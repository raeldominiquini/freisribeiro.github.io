### Build, Control, or Manipulate?

After a deep research into the idea of “caustics” and its effects, I started to question myself how the patterns that are created can be used. Different projects and works shown in this blog present a variety of ways that the effect of caustic can be explored: it can be build, as the Synesthetic Museum by Francois Mangion, it can be controlled, as in the work of P. Bompas, or it can be manipulated through the 3d printed glass technique.

What I’m interested, however, is in the way Caustics can be used in architecture.
